# PLAN 6122: Urban Analytics

<br> 

This repo contains code and data used for Department of Urban and Environmental Planning course delivered during the spring of 2023 at the University of Virginia. 

## Description

This course introduces the principles and techniques of data science with an emphasis on geospatial data using examples and applications drawn from cities in the U.S. and around the world. It also introduces frameworks and several case studies for the ethical use and governance of data in the public realm. PLAN 6122 familiarizes students with the R programming language and RStudio environment; covers fundamentals such as data input/output, debugging, and looping; and builds proficiency in areas like data visualization, web-based mapping, and querying APIs. 
Each student will design and implement an individual term project that integrates the tools of data science with geospatial data to explore an issue or research question drawn from urban planning or public policy. Although prior experience with geospatial data or coding would be useful, neither is required. 

## Instructional Methods

This is a fast-paced course intended to introduce students to the fundamental concepts and techniques of urban analytics. Because the substantive focus is on cities and urban analytics, geospatial data analysis figures prominently in the lecture and lab exercise materials. We begin an overview of the R language and RStudio environment, which will serve as the foundation for your work in this class. Students will build proficiency with R programming, data wrangling and visualization, static and interactive mapping, and fundamental machine learning techniques. Students are expected to also cultivate an ability to interpret and explain the implications of the visualization and analysis components of their work in plain language. Class meetings are generally divided into lecture (Tuesdays) and laboratory sessions (Thursdays) that focus on concepts and practical applications, respectively. Lab reports are due at the beginning of the subsequent class period and should be written independently. The term project for the course will focus on integrating the tools of data science with geospatial data to explore a specific real-world planning issue or research question. This is an individual project and students will define the scope of the project and identify specific deliverable(s) early in the semester. Reproducing an existing analysis or study using different data or an alternate study area is also acceptable for the term project.
